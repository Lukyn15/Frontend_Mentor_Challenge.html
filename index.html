            <h2>Verified Graduate</h2>
            <h3>  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so,
                in the company I joined. I<br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3>
            <p>  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a<br>
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                the course, I’ve <br>successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

             <h4> Such a life-changing<br> experience. Highly <br>recommended!
             </h4>
             <p>  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br> never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from
                 professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former
                 student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff
                 did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long <br> assistance. The agile team
                 project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial
                 could ever have. In<br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent
                 experience. It certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers.
                 100% recommend! ”</p>

                 gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>myself as a capable
